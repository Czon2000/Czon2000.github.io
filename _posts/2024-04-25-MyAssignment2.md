This is a record of my progess:

## Question 1

I spent a lot of time learning the *ROC curve* and drew it in my homework. But I don't know if what I drew is correct.

## Question 3

For the GPU part, the comparison of batch size is based on a GPU with 8GB of memory. My personal computer has only 2GB of graphics memory (MX250), and during testing, it was found that even if the *batch size* is adjusted to 2, the GPU load can still reach 100%. In addition, the increase in temperatureo leads to a serious decrease in the running speed of the graphics card. After two rounds of deep learning, the time spent on the third round of learning is equivalent to or even more than the CPU's deep learning's, so that after each run, I have to shut down my laptop to cool down.

## Question 4

The learning of *t-SNE* cost me much time, but I cannot finish it due to my foolishness. From tuitions on webs, drawing t-SNE needs embedding, I haven't understand data format in fastai, which led to my failure. My lack of programming experience makes it impossible to complete drawing tasks.
